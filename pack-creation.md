# XML Types

This mod can read two different kinds of XML configuration files

## OneSize
For traffic light packs that replace vanilla traffic light props one to one. This is best for legacy/limited prop packs

## MultiSize
For packs that have traffic lights for different road sizes/ have several variations per road size. This requires more prop models than the onesize format, but it can take full advantage of the mod's features

# XML Template

As a starting point to make a new configuration, use these blank XML templates [here](https://github.com/Cgameworld/TrafficLightReplacer/tree/master/TrafficLightReplacer/Templates) or export them using the mod's Asset Creator Tool

If you are on Windows, [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) with the XMLTools plugin is recommended to edit these files, since it includes features such as text highlighting, syntax checking and pretty printing.  

Example Blank XML Template:\

For examples of fully working xml files, look at the mod's [internal XML presets](https://github.com/Cgameworld/TrafficLightReplacer/tree/master/TrafficLightReplacer/DefaultXMLS)

# XML Elements

### PackName
The name of the pack shown in game

### OneSize
[Type](#xml-types) of XML file, ```true``` means it is a OneSize configuration, ```false``` means it is a MultiSize configuration

### Prefab
Prefab name of the prop, use the update/copy buttons in the Asset Creator Tool to grab


### Type
Defines the type of prop to replace

For **OneSize** files, types can be set to ```Main``` , ```Mirror``` , ```Ped Signal```, or ```Signal Pole``` with only one prop per type.

For **MultiSize** files types can be set to ```Small```, ```Medium```, ```Large``` or ```Signal Pole```.

For multisize configurations, types small, medium and large can be assigned to multiple props, while signal pole can only be assigned to one prop. All the types (small, medium, large, signal pole) have to have at least one asset assigned, otherwise the pack does not work


### Name
Name of the prop shown in the customization dropdown (**MultiSize only**)

### Description
Tooltip shown in the customization dropdown (**MultiSize only**)

### Transform
(**optional**)\
\
Default transform settings for the pack\

### DropdownSelectionIndex
(**optional, MultiSize only**)\
\
Default variation selected for each size in the customization menu. Use this if you want something other than the first prop for a size category selected when loading the pack\
\
**SmallRoads** - index for Small Roads dropdown\
**MediumRoads** - index for Medium Roads dropdown\
**LargeRoads** - index for Large Roads dropdown

index values start at 0\
\
Example:\
![dropdown selection index example](/assets/images/DropdownSelectionIndexExample.png)\
To have the second traffic light in this list to be selected on default, change the MediumRoads element value to ```1```

# Loading

To load a custom prop pack, place a TLRConfig.xml file in the workshop asset folder when publishing. 

For testing, place a xml with any name in the TLRLocal folder generated by the mod’s Asset Creation Tool Window (enable in settings). Also check the “Load TLRLocal Folder” checkbox for the mod to load XMLs in that folder.

XML templates can be exported with the Asset Creator Tool or can be found here: [xml templates](https://github.com/Cgameworld/TrafficLightReplacer/tree/master/TrafficLightReplacer/Templates)

I’ll make a more detailed tutorial later on about this

The mod reads files from

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\255710 (any enabled/subscribed subfolder) - file in workshop folder has to named TLRLocal.xml

\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\TLRLocal - can be named anything

Two xml types exist, onesize and multisize. Onesize (mostly for legacy packs) replaces vanilla signals one to one , while multisize is the main custom implementation that has support for traffic light variations, etc.

All the types (small, medium, large, signal pole) have to have at least one member otherwise the mod doesn’t work
