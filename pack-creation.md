# XML Types

This mod can read two different kinds of XML configuration files, types **OneSize** and **MultiSize**


## OneSize
For traffic light packs that replace the vanilla traffic lights one to one. For example 1 traffic light prop replacing 1 vanilla prop. This is best for legacy/limited prop packs

## MultiSize
For packs that have traffic lights for different roads sizes/ have several varations per road size. of advantage road size detection and that can have multiple selectable props per road size. This xml file type requires more prop models than the onesize format, but it can take full advantage of the mod

# XML Format

Find the [xml templates here](https://github.com/Cgameworld/TrafficLightReplacer/tree/master/TrafficLightReplacer/Templates) or export them using the mod's Asset Creator Tool

## Elements

### PackName
The name of the pack shown in game

### OneSize
Type of XML file, ```true``` means it is a OneSize file, ```false``` means it is a MultiSize file

### Assets
Asset Data Container

#### Prefab
Prefab name of the prop, use the update/copy buttons in the Asset Creator tool to grab this

### Type
Defines the type of prop for the mod

For OneSize files, types can be ```Main``` , ```Mirror``` , ```Ped Signal```, ```Signal Pole``` with only one prop per type.

For Multisize files types can be ```Small```, ```Medium```, ```Large``` or ```Signal Pole```. Small, Medium and Large can be assigned to multiple assets, with each showing up as a new option in the mod's dropdown while Signal Pole can only be assigned to one prop.



To load a custom prop pack, place a TLRConfig.xml file in the workshop asset folder when publishing. 

For testing, place a xml with any name in the TLRLocal folder generated by the mod’s Asset Creation Tool Window (enable in settings). Also check the “Load TLRLocal Folder” checkbox for the mod to load XMLs in that folder.

XML templates can be exported with the Asset Creator Tool or can be found here: [xml templates](https://github.com/Cgameworld/TrafficLightReplacer/tree/master/TrafficLightReplacer/Templates)

I’ll make a more detailed tutorial later on about this

The mod reads files from

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\255710 (any enabled/subscribed subfolder) - file in workshop folder has to named TLRLocal.xml

\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\TLRLocal - can be named anything

Two xml types exist, onesize and multisize. Onesize (mostly for legacy packs) replaces vanilla signals one to one , while multisize is the main custom implementation that has support for traffic light variations, etc.

All the types (small, medium, large, signal pole) have to have at least one member otherwise the mod doesn’t work
